# Automation of Invoice Reporting with UiPath

## Problem
Finance managers needed to track invoices and identify which ones were coming due by specific dates, but lacked time to manually review each invoice among their many other responsibilities. The manual process required opening each invoice, copying relevant information into a spreadsheet, and writing purchase descriptions for each company—a time-consuming task that diverted attention from more strategic financial management.

## Solution
Designed and implemented an automated RPA (Robotic Process Automation) workflow using UiPath to eliminate manual invoice processing. The system automatically extracts invoice data, identifies invoices due by the target date (09/22/2025), compiles purchase descriptions, and generates organized reports—freeing finance managers to focus on higher-value activities.

## Technologies Used
- UiPath (RPA platform)
- Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
- Spreadsheet automation
- Data extraction and parsing
- Workflow orchestration
- Log management and error tracking

## Key Features
- Automated invoice data extraction
- Due date identification and filtering
- Purchase description compilation
- Automated spreadsheet population
- Error logging and tracking
- Flagging system for invoices requiring attention
- Organized output for easy review

## Workflow Process
1. System accesses invoice files
2. Extracts relevant data (due dates, amounts, vendor info)
3. Filters invoices by target due date
4. Generates purchase descriptions
5. Populates spreadsheet with organized data
6. Creates log entries for tracking
7. Flags invoices requiring immediate attention

## Results & Benefits
- **Time Savings:** Eliminated hours of manual data entry and invoice review
- **Improved Organization:** Centralized invoice information in one accessible location
- **Better Prioritization:** Clear visibility into which invoices need immediate attention
- **Reduced Errors:** Automated extraction eliminates manual data entry mistakes
- **Enhanced Focus:** Finance managers can concentrate on strategic financial decisions
- **Seamless Process:** Creates reliable, repeatable workflow for ongoing invoice management

## Challenges & Future Improvements
**What Worked Well:**
